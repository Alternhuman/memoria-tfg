The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},

Abstract

   This document describes a format for a Lightweight Directory Access
   Protocol (LDAP) Uniform Resource Locator (URL).  An LDAP URL
   describes an LDAP search operation that is used to retrieve
   information from an LDAP directory, or, in the context of an LDAP
   referral or reference, an LDAP URL describes a service where an LDAP
   operation may be progressed.
