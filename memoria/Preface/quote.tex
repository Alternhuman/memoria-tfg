% Now comes the "Funny Quote", written in italics
Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,\\
Old Time is still a-flying:\\
And this same flower that smiles to-day\\
To-morrow will be dying.\\
 
The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,\\
The higher he's a-getting,\\
The sooner will his race be run,\\
And nearer he 's to setting.\\
 
That age is best which is the first,\\
When youth and blood are warmer;\\
But being spent, the worse, and worst\\
Times still succeed the former.\\
 
Then be not coy, but use your time,\\
And while ye may, go marry:\\
For having lost but once your prime,\\
You may for ever tarry.\\
